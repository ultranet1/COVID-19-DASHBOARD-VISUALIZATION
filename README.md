# COVID-19_DASHBOARD_VISUALIZATION

I used Tableau desktop to create COVID-19 interactive dashboard.

DISCLAIMER: This is a very complex topic and situation right now. This project is meant to sharpen my skills, and its not an authority to be considered. I leave that to experts, many of whom have already done this.
COVID-19 data is not a “cool new dataset” to play with and data visualizations in this context MUST NOT be misleading, inaccurate, or incite panic. Each data point represents a person.
